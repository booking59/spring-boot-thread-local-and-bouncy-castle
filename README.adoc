This project is a Small Spring boot rest project to demostrate how to use MDC
and Bouncy Castle in Spring boot applications

== Thread Local in Java and MDC implementation

The ThreadLocal class in Java enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread. Thus, even if two threads are executing the same code, and the code has a reference to a ThreadLocal variable, then the two threads cannot see each other's ThreadLocal variables.

In this example we are going to create custom String Threadlocal into Spring boot application to demostrate how a Treadlocal class has the same value between request-response servlet lifecycle.

We have created custom servlet filter class named CustomFilter (filter package). This class filter every hhtp call make to the api and add correlationId value into our custom threadlocal class named MyThreadLocal (threadlocal package)

3 tipical layers controller-service-repository was created to log this value to be able to demostrate that it is not neccesary to
pass the value between method: this value is stored at the same thread so it is accesible for every layers.

To be able to run the Spring boot application write inside a terminal`` *mvn spring-boot:run*`` or if you a pro developer and you use intellij run inside the ide.
Open you browser and type "http://localhost:8080/person" and your logs will be shown with correlationId value stored inside threadlocal.

== MDC log4j map


MDC in Log4j allows us to fill a map-like structure with pieces of information that are accessible to the appender when the log message is actually written.

The MDC structure is internally attached to the executing thread in the same way a *ThreadLocal variable* would be.
The pattern of the appender should be obviously changed in order to retrieve the variables stored in the MDC.

So letâ€™s see our Spring boot code to see how to use it inside and Spring boot application.
Firs of all we have to store the value in the filter class as the same way as we have done with our Mythreadlocal.

It is enough to change the conversion pattern, using the %X{} placeholder for each entry contained in the MDC we would like to be logged:

`logging.pattern.level=correlationId:[%X{correlationId}] %5p`

Now if we start again our Spring boot application logs will be automatic appended inside log:

Obviusly values of thread local and MDC are the same between request but MDC make easier to log custom values inside logs.
